Yes, it is generally a good idea to create browser tests for the same features/interactions that one already has integration tests for. While integration tests ensure that different parts of your application work together correctly, browser tests simulate real user interactions and ensure that the application works correctly from a user's perspective. They can catch issues that may not be detected by integration tests, such as problems with JavaScript execution, CSS issues, and other browser-specific quirks. Therefore, having both types of tests for the same features can provide a more comprehensive test coverage.

Here are some best practices for integration and browser tests that can be used for your project:

1. **Test Independence**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state created by other tests. This ensures that tests can be run in any order and that a failure in one test does not cascade to others.

2. **Use Mocks and Stubs**: For integration tests, use mocks and stubs to isolate the component being tested. This allows you to focus on the integration points and reduces the complexity of the test.

3. **Test All Layers**: Ensure that your tests cover all layers of your application, from the database to the user interface.

4. **Use Realistic Data**: Use data that is as close as possible to the real data that your application will handle. This will help catch issues that may not be apparent with simplified test data.

5. **Automate**: Automate your tests as much as possible. This ensures that they are run regularly and that any regressions are caught quickly.

6. **Use a Continuous Integration (CI) system**: A CI system can automatically run your tests whenever changes are pushed to your repository. This provides quick feedback on the impact of your changes.

7. **Test Different Browsers**: For browser tests, ensure that your tests are run on all the browsers that your application supports. Different browsers can behave differently, and it's important to catch any browser-specific issues.

8. **Handle Asynchronous Behavior**: Many web applications have asynchronous behavior. Make sure your tests can handle this correctly, for example by using waits or polling.

9. **Check Visual Elements**: In addition to functionality, browser tests should also check visual elements like layout, colors, fonts, etc. This can help catch visual regressions.

10. **Keep Tests Maintainable**: As your application grows, so will your tests. It's important to keep them well-organized and easy to update. This often involves using good naming conventions, keeping tests small and focused, and avoiding duplication.

Remember, the goal of testing is to increase confidence in your application. The exact practices you follow may vary based on your specific needs and context.
